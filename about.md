Don't make the mistake and think we are a so called "camgirl-studio". Because we are not. We are a marketing & management agency that works with adult-models.

You'll be treated as a cooperation-partner - we work together and both benefit from it. There is no weird employer/employee relationship.

That means:

*   We do NOT own your accounts. And never will be.

*   We do NOT own your content. And never will be.

*   We do NOT lock you into a contract where you can't get out. You can stop the cooperation anytime if you are unhappy. 

*   We do NOT require a work schedule from you. W
