Don't make the mistake and think we are a so called "camgirl-studio". Because we are not.

We are a marketing & management agency that focuses on working with adult-models.
Also, we work together. There is no weird employer/employee relationship.
We both have obligations to work together successfully. 

But don't forget:

*   We do NOT require a work schedule from you.

*   We do NOT demand a minimum of workhours.

*   We do NOT own your accounts.

*   We do NOT own your content.

*   We do NOT lock you into a contract where you can't get out.

*   You are a freelancer, so work whenever you want and how many hoursÂ you want.

*   You are a personal brand, we are a marketing agency. You own your accounts, forever.

*   You perform in front of the camera, so you have the media rights for your content.
