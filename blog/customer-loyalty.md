We surveyed marketers about the rapid growth of the OnlyFans adult website and how brands and individuals can be successful in marketing. Here are some of the keys to marketing the site. Matt Bertram, CEO and SEO strategist at EEA Digital, says the site has a potential for open-minded marketers. The site can be used to produce videos, photos and other content for a range of niches.

The platform is subscription-based, which means you can charge users a monthly fee to maintain their account. You can also create exclusive content to sell to your subscribers. Selling exclusive content can be lucrative for content creators with a large and engaged audience. The site is also not limited to adult content.

Although OnlyFans is conceived as a mix of Patreon, Twitter and Instagram, most marketers are unaware of its true potential. It is known for its adult content but its use by content creators in other genres such as modeling, physical fitness, games, entertainment and cryptocurrencies. I believe it will only become mainstream when adventurous brands advertise there.

Scott Hastings, co-founder of Betworthy, says that OnlyFans 

 are an interesting subject because it's such a divided base. Some love them, while others do not see the meaning of their existence.

For advertisers, the reach potential is important, but more important is the type of audience that is part of a particular source. If Gatorade advertises better on ESPN than CNN, their target market for CNN will be higher than the coverage on ESPN.

OnlyFans have a huge user base, but they don't come to the market. They are not in a state of mind where they think about ads before buying.

If your brand has a negative outlook, people will find that you advertise on an adult site. No matter how hard OnlyFans try to act as a social media platform, they are nothing more than a porn site. For this reason, I see no marketing opportunity for brands in such a small niche.

Flynn Zaiger, founder of Washington-based digital marketing agency Marketing, says that in order to market OnlyFans successfully, users must do the same thing as any other social platform: Create interesting and engaging content that they can find in your feed. He does not believe that brands can be successful on OnlyFan, but notes that it is important to remember that social networks like OnlyFan have changed over time. While other social networks may require thousands or even millions of followers to make a living as influencers, their premium aspect allows users to succeed with dozens or even hundreds of followers, which is a much smaller amount than on mainstream websites. The main difference is that OnlyFan feels similar to Tumblr in terms of the success that can be found in the niche.

Many Tumblr users assumed in the early years that it would never become mainstream, but the purchase of Yahoo in 2013 changed that. It would not surprise me to see a similar acquisition of OnlyFans in the future, which could lead to greater acceptance of the platform by the mainstream. So far, OnlyFans has experienced radical growth. Expect to read a lot more about it in the coming days.
